Advantages and disadvantages of text files.


Different text file formats will have their own pros and cons. But we’ve compiled some of the most typical benefits and drawbacks here.


Advantages.


Simplicity. Text file formats are easy to use and create. This means you won’t typically encounter complex or technical challenges or need specific knowledge or expertise, to use them.
Easy to recover. Text files can be easier to recover if data corruption occurs.
Small and easily shareable. Text documents are often much smaller than other types of files, so they can be easily shared and stored.
Highly accessible. Basic text file formats can be easily opened by most computers and devices without the need for any complex software. They are widely supported on different programmes.


Disadvantages.


Lack of formatting. The lack of formatting in basic text files makes them unsuitable for visual projects or documents that require images and fonts.
Security. A double-edged effect of their simplicity, some text-based file types can be susceptible to data theft and damage from malicious software.
